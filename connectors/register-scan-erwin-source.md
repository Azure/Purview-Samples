# Register and Scan erwin Mart Server (Preview)

This article outlines how to register an Erwin Mart Server in Purview
and set up a scan.

## Supported capabilities

The erwin source supports Full scan to extract metadata from an Erwin
Mart server. The metadata include:

1.  Logical only models with Entities, Attributes and Domains OR
2.  Physical only models with Tables, Columns, Data types OR
3.  Logical/Physical models

This data source also fetches Lineage between data assets.

## Prerequisites

1.  Set up the latest [self-hosted integration
    runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717).
    For more information, seeÂ [Create and configure a self-hosted
    integration
    runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime).

    > [!Note]
    > Make sure to run self-hosted integration runtime on the VM where erwin Mart instance is running.

2.  Make sure [JDK
    11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
    is installed on your virtual machine where self-hosted integration
    runtime is installed.

3.  Make sure \"Visual C++ Redistributable 2012 Update 4\" is installed
    on the VM where self-hosted integration runtime is running. If you
    don\'t have it installed, download it from
    [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

4.  Supported erwin Mart versions are 9.x to 2021

## Feature Flag

Registration and scanning of BigQuery source is available behind a
feature flag. Append the following to your URL:
&feature.ext.datasource={\"erwin\":\"true\"}

> E.g., full URL
> [https://web.purview.azure.com/?feature.ext.datasource={\"erwin\":\"true\"}](https://web.purview.azure.com/?feature.ext.datasource=%7b%22erwin%22:%22true%22%7d)

## Setting up authentication for a scan

The only supported authentication for an erwin Mart source is Server

## Creating and running a scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1.  In the Management Center, click on Integration runtimes. Make sure a
    self-hosted integration runtime is set up on the VM where erwin Mart
    instance is running. If it is not set up, use the steps mentioned
    [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/purview/manage-integration-runtimes)
    to setup a self-hosted integration runtime

2.  Navigate to **Sources**.

3.  Select the registered **erwin** Mart.

4.  Select **+ New scan**.

5.  Provide the below details:

    a.  **Name**: The name of the scan

    b.  **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the configured
        self-hosted integration runtime.

    c.  **Server name, Port** and **Application name** are auto
        populated based on the values entered during registration.

    d.  **Credential:** Select the credential configured to connect to
        your erwin Mart server. While creating a credential, make sure
        to:
    - Select **Basic Authentication** as the Authentication method
    - Provide your erwin Mart server's username in the User name
            field.
    - Save your user password for server authentication in the
             key vault's secret.

    To understand more on credentials, refer to the link

    e.  **Use Internet Information Services (IIS)** -- Select True or False
    to notify if Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) must be
    used when connecting to the erwin Mart server. By default, this
    value is set to False.
