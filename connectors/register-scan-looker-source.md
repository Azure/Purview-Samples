# Register and Scan Looker(Preview)

This article outlines how to register a Looker Server in Purview and set
up a scan.

## Supported capabilities

The Looker source supports Full scan to extract metadata from a Looker
server. It imported metadata from a Looker server, including database
connections, LookML Models and associated reports (Looks and
Dashboards). This data source also fetches Lineage between data assets.

## Prerequisites

1.  Set up the latest [self-hosted integration
    runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717).
    For more information, seeÂ [Create and configure a self-hosted
    integration
    runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime).

2.  Make sure [JDK
    11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
    is installed on your virtual machine where self-hosted integration
    runtime is installed.

3.  Make sure \"Visual C++ Redistributable 2012 Update 4\" is installed
    on the VM where self-hosted integration runtime is running. If you
    don\'t have it installed, download it from
    [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

4.  Supported Looker server version is 7.2

## Feature Flag

Registration and scanning of BigQuery source is available behind a
feature flag. Append the following to your URL:
&feature.ext.datasource={\"looker\":\"true\"}

## Setting up authentication for a scan

An API3 key is required to connect to the Looker server. The API3 key
